## RudderStack Contributor Agreement

To contribute to this project, we need you to sign the [**Contributor License Agreement (“CLA”)**][CLA] for the first commit you make. By agreeing to the [**CLA**][CLA], we can add you to list of approved contributors and review the changes proposed by you.

## How you can contribute to RudderStack

If you come across any issues or bugs, or have any suggestions for improvement, you can navigate to the specific file in the [**repo**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-repo-template), make the change, and raise a PR.

You can also contribute to any open-source RudderStack project. View our [**GitHub page**](https://github.com/rudderlabs) to see all the different projects.

## Committing

We prefer squash or rebase commits so that all changes from a branch are committed to master as a single commit. All pull requests are squashed when merged, but rebasing prior to merge gives you better control over the commit message.

## Getting help

For any questions, concerns, or queries, you can start by asking a question in our [**Slack**](https://rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack-community/) community.

### We look forward to your feedback on improving this project!
